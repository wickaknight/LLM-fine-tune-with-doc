And above him, he could see nothing. The precipice was sheer, and the top of it was, perhaps, farther away than the sea", "question": "Do you think that the young seagull’s parents were harsh to him? Why?", "answer": "No, the young seagull’s parents weren’t harsh to him. They were just teaching him a lifetime learning experience which is vital for his survival."}
{"context": "The young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two brothers and his sister had already flown away the day before. He had been afraid to fly with them. Somehow, when he had taken a little run forward to the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his wings, he became afraid. The great expanse of sea stretched down beneath, and it was such a long way down – miles down. He felt certain that his wings would never support him; so he bent his head and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge where he slept at night. Even when each of his brothers and his little sister, whose wings were far shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage to take that plunge which appeared to him so desperate. His father and mother had come around calling to him shrilly, scolding him, threatening to let him starve on his ledge, unless he flew away. But for the life of him, he could not move. That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then, nobody had come near him. The day before, all day long,", "question": "What did the young bird’s family do when he started flying?", "answer": "They were flying around him, praising, soaring, and diving together with him."}

That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then, nobody had come near him. The day before, all day long, he had watched his parents flying about with his brothers and sister, perfecting them in the art of flight, teaching them how to skim the waves and how to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older brother catch his first herring and devour it, standing on a rock, while his parents circled around raising a proud cackle. And all the morning, the whole family had walked about on the big plateau midway down the opposite cliff, laughing at his cowardice. The sun was now ascending the sky, blazing warmly on his ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat because he had not eaten since the previous nightfall. Then, he had found a dried piece of mackerel’s tail at the far end of his ledge. Now, there was not a single scrap of food left. He had searched every inch, rooting among the rough, dirt-caked straw", "question": "How was the young seagull’s first attempt to fly?", "answer": "The young seagull was very hungry. So he dived at the fish that was in his mother’s beak. But he fell into space and became terribly afraid. His heart stood still. He could hear nothing for just a minute. The next moment he felt his wings spread outwards and began to fly up and down fearless into the sky."}
